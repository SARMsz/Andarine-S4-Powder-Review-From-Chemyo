<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As a fitness enthusiast who’s tried dozens of supplements over the years, I’m always on the lookout for something that really moves the needle on lean muscle, strength, and fat loss. That’s why I decided to test <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/andarine-s4-powder/?campaign=github&ref=166">Andarine (S4) Powder by Chemyo</a>. In this review, I’ll share exactly how I tested and ranked this product, what I noticed week by week, and why it might be the perfect addition to your cutting or strength cycle.</p>

<h2>What Is Andarine (S4)?</h2>
<p>Andarine, also known as S-4, is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM). Unlike anabolic steroids, SARMs bind specifically to androgen receptors in muscle and bone tissue. This selectivity helps you build lean muscle mass, increase strength, and burn fat—without the harsh side effects often linked to traditional steroids.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>To make this review as honest and hands‑on as possible, I followed these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity Check:</strong> I ordered Andarine S4 powder from Chemyo and compared its lab report to a Swisschems sample. Both showed 99%+ purity, but Chemyo’s COA was easier to verify online.</li>
  <li><strong>Dosage Setup:</strong> I ran an 8‑week cycle at 25 mg/day, splitting doses morning and evening to maintain blood levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Logs:</strong> I tracked my bench, squat, and deadlift numbers weekly. I also measured body weight, body-fat percentage, and muscle hardness.</li>
  <li><strong>Side‑Effect Monitoring:</strong> I paid close attention to vision changes, joint comfort, and overall mood.</li>
  <li><strong>Comparative Ranking:</strong> I ranked Chemyo’s Andarine against Swisschems, PureRawz, and other top SARMs brands based on purity, price per milligram, and real‑world results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Personal Experience (Week by Week)</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1–2:</strong> Energy felt stable. No jitters or crash. I noticed a slight increase in vascularity, especially in shoulders and arms.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3–4:</strong> Bench press went up by 10 lbs, squat by 15 lbs. Muscle hardness improved visibly around the quads and traps. Fat around the midsection felt “softer” to burn off.</p>
<p><strong>Week 5–6:</strong> Strength gains continued—deadlift jumped by 20 lbs. I dropped 1.5 kg of body fat without changing my diet. Joints felt lubricated, no swelling.</p>
<p><strong>Week 7–8:</strong> Final two weeks showed peak muscle density. My physique looked leaner, veins more pronounced. Strength plateaued slightly, which is normal at the end of a cycle.</p>

<h2>Key Benefits</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lean Muscle Building:</strong> Andarine targets androgen receptors in muscle, leading to dense, hard gains without water retention.</li>
  <li><strong>Fat Loss:</strong> Boosts metabolic rate for cutting phases—helped me drop stubborn belly fat.</li>
  <li><strong>Joint Support:</strong> Enhanced bone density and joint comfort, making heavy lifts feel smoother.</li>
  <li><strong>Clearer Vision:</strong> Some S4 users report slight yellow tint; I experienced no vision problems at my dosage.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimal Side Effects:</strong> No acne, no mood swings, no estrogenic issues.</li>
</ul>
